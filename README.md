# Motion-Detection
Motion Detection using Python

This repository contains a Python project for real-time motion detection using OpenCV. The goal of the project is to detect motion in a video stream by analyzing frame differences. The notebook demonstrates the step-by-step process of capturing video input, processing each frame, detecting changes, and visualizing the motion with bounding boxes.

### Features
- Captures live video stream or video file.
- Uses frame differencing to detect motion in the video.
- Draws bounding boxes around moving objects.
- Displays the processed video stream in real-time.
- Adjustable sensitivity for motion detection based on contour area size.

### Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- opencv-python
- numpy
- matplotlib
